# advent-2024-rust

This is my code for the 2024 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024),
all solutions in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

All code is under the `src` directory. Each solution-file is named `dayNN.rs`
and contains both puzzle solutions for that day. These are the
publically-facing functions `part1` and `part2`. Unlike the code I use to
actually do the AoC challenge, this is written well after the fact.

## Usage

This project is managed with [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/). Running
the following will download any dependencies and build the executable:

```
cargo build
```
